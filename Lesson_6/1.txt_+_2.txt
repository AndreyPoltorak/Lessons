I like to read very much. Reading is my hobby. I have got a lot of books at home. I like to read books for children. I like to read short stories about animals and fairy tales. My favourite fairy tale is Cinderella.Children can have different hobbies. Some children collect toys or postcards, some children like to read or play. My hobby is reading. I like to read books for children. I also like to go for walks in the park. I usually make pictures when I walk. Making photos is my hobby, too.
